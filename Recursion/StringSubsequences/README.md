# Problem Statement

Given a string of length lets say N, return all subsequences of the string.

Subsequences contain all the strings varying from 0 to N. But the order of characters should remain same as the input string.
Note: The order of subsequences does not matter.

sample input:
abc

sample output:
""
c
b
bc
a
ac
ab
abc
